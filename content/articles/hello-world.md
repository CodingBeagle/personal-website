The next planned step is also to set up a {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" target="_blank">Digital Garden</a>.{{< /rawhtml >}} The concept sounds interesting, and it would be fun to have a contiously growing body of knowledge that is also accessible to whoever wants to read along. Additionally, creating a Digital Garden from scratch would be a great opportunity for me to learn more front-end development whilst creating a uniquely personal space.
