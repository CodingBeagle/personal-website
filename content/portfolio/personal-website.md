The very website you're on right now is one of my own personal projects.

I created it as part of my effort to upgrade my front-end development skills. Historically I've focused a lot on back-end development and low-level programming, as it's an area I've always loved.

However, I love to learn new things, and as it turns out, I'm finding front-end development to be a lot of fun as well.

When I learn something new, I like to get a good understanding and handle of the fundamentals. Therefore, this website is build using the {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">static site generator Hugo</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. I found a static site generator to be the perfect solution, as it provides ample opportunity for me to code my own website with low overhead in complexity from over-the-top fancy frameworks that require specific templates or a host of unecessary technologies.

With Hugo, I was able to focus simply on creating a website using fundamental web technologies.

### Technologies Used

* {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}.
* HTML and CSS for the entire website layout.
