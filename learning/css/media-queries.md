# Media Queries

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries>

Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type or specific parameters (screen resolution or browser viewport width).

Media queries are used for the following:

- Conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import at rules.
- To target specific media for the *style*, *link* and *source* HTML elements.
